Project 1

For this project, I created a usable general aviation dataset from Kaggle.com. 
This is a dataset from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Accident/Incident Database providing 
details about each aviation accident that has occurred from 1962 to the present. 
This dataset will be used for Project 2 and Project 3.

Tasks completed: Data cleaning, Adding Latitude and Longitude to each entry, Loading and exploring data, splitting 
into train and test sets, plotting train set and considering if transformations are necessary.

Project summary: Travelling by air is the fastest means to get from point A to point B. Flight is also a passion 
for many who are willing to accept the inherent risks. This project explores general aviation accidents that occurred 
over six decades in the United States. Specifically, I am looking at the accidents and incidents by make and model of the plane
to see if there is a connection between aircraft manufacturers and injury accidents to help determine safety performance 
and trends. The severity of injury will be rated by “Fatal” and “Non-Fatal” and a column called "Lethality" was created 
that indicates Fatal as 1 and Non-Fatal as 0. Additionally, I will look at the weather impact and the time in flight when 
the accident occurred.  

For project 2: I want to predict if a pilot will survive based on the features in the data like:
- Plane Make 
- Weather
- Time in flight accident occurred
- Engine type

I left several columns in the data file for the time being and some will be removed and relevant  transformations will be applied.
